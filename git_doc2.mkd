Here is a file I will track using git. It's  not a terribly large file, but it's got a few sentences in it.

And a new paragraph.

git is getting a little easier, but I am still not sure how to handle all the PDF stuff. I will get further information about it when I can, but for the time being I just want to get better at using the basic commands.
